## Testing DecodeME variants with AlphaGenome

- `DecodeME/batch_decodeme.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook which scores significant variants from the DecodeME study using AlphaGenome with the RNAseq scorer
- `DecodeME/gwas1_log10p_gt_7.tsv` - Variants from DecodeME with -log10p value >= 7.
- `variant_scores_rnaseq_decodeme_significant_all_tissues.csv.gz` - All scores returned by AlphaGenome. (~126 MB)
- `DecodeME/variant-scores_rnaseq_decodeme_significant_brain_protein-coding.csv` - Only scores for brain expression of protein coding genes. (1.2 MB)
